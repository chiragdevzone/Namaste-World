Q.1 What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples.

    (i) Adding Local images

         -> store images in your project directory (e.g., in a folder like src/assets).

         -> <img src={localImage} alt="local Example" />

    (ii) Using Remote Image URLs

        -> Fetch and display an image from a URL.

        -> <img src="https://example.com/image.png" alt="Remote Example" />

    (iii) Dynamic Images 

        -> const [image, setImage] = useState("image1.png");
        <button onClick={()=> setImage("image2.png)}>Change Image </button>
        <img src={`./assets/${image}`} alt="Dynamic Example" />

    (iv) Using Libraries for Image Management

        -> npm install react-image

        import { Img } from 'react-image';

        <Img src="https://example.com/large-image.png"
        loader={<p> Loading... </p>}
        alt="Lazy Loaded Example" />
Q.2 What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?

    ->If you call console.log(useState()) in a React Component, it will log an array containing two elements:

        (i) Initial state : The current value of the state variable (or the initial value provided when calling useState);

        (ii) State Setter Function : A function that allows you to update the state.

Q.3 How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array ?

    -> If we don't add a dependency array then useEffect will be called on each and every time while rendering of the respective component.

Q.4 What is SPA?

    -> SPA stands for Single Page Application, which means there is no reloading while routing from one page to another, here just component rerendering get placed.

Q.5 What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing ?

    -> Client Side Routing : In this Routing when we move from one page to another then the component gots rerender only there is no server call for diff diff pages

    -> Server Side Routing : In this Routing for each page we have to make a server call to accesss. For example : about.html, contact.html etc.
