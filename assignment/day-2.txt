    -> NPM is a package manager which manage the packages  into our app.
    -> NPM stands for everything except Node Package Manager.

Q.2 What is 'Parcel/Webpack'? Why do we need it?

    -> these are the bundlers which are the tools that bundles our app, packages our app so that it can be shipped to production.

    -> we need bundlers bcoz they make our app fast by minifist, optimse, HMR(Hot module Replacement) image optimisation, compression etc.

Q.3 What is '.parcel-cache'

    -> it is a folder which is created while running our app. parcel caches the code into in in the binary format. at the first time it takes some time in ms while building our app but once parcel cahches our code then the time gets reduced let say from 495ms to 6ms.

Q.4 What is 'npx'?

    -> npx helps to execute the packages which are been installed by npm.

Q.5 What is diff b/w 'dependencies' vs 'devDependencies'

    -> the packages which are used during the development phase are goes under the devDependencies where as the packages which are used in production phase are goes under dependencies.

Q.6 What is Tree Shaking?

    -> Tree Shaking is the algorithm which is used to remove the unwanted/dead code from our app so that it can be fast.

Q.7 What is Hot Module Replacement?

    -> HMR is a method in which it uses File Watching algorithm to track all the files in the app. and if there is any chages occuresin realtime in the file then tells the server to reload.

Q.8 List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.

    ->superpowers are as follow:
        (i) HMR
        (ii) Parcel Cache
        (iii) Tree Shaking 
        (iv) Minifist
        (v) Compression

    -> (i) Tree Shaking: tree shaking is the technique in which it removes the unwanted/dead code form the app.
       (ii) Minifist: in this the parcel cleans the code, removes the console log tec.
       (iii) Compression: in this it compress our code and make the and do optimisation so that it can run fast.

Q.9  What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
     -> it is a file which hold the name of the another files and folder which should be igonored by the git to push them into the repositories because they have very bulky size and can be regenerated by commands.

     -> the code of files which can be regenerated by commands should be added into gitignore and the files which are essentials and can not be generated by commands or automatically should not be added into gitignore.

Q.10 What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

    -> Package.json file is the configuration for npm. whatever packages our project needs, we install those packages using npm install <packageName>.

    -> Package-lock.json locks the exact version of packages being used in the project.

Q.11 Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?

    -> Because it helps keep our project's dependencies consistent. Changing it can cause problems and bugs. let npm manage itself for us.

Q.12 - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
    -> node_modules are like database for the npm. every dependency in node_module will have its package.json.

    -> Node Modules are very heavy so we should put this in git ignore.

Q.13 What is the `dist` folder?

    -> parcel bundles our app together or packes the app and put it into the dist folder. the files in the folders are minifist, optimsed to make the app fast.

Q.14 What is `browserlists`

    -> browserlist is a tool that specifies which browers should be supported/compatible in your frontend app.
